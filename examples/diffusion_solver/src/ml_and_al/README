****** FOR train_net.py ******

# TO RUN
python train_net.py 
        --card gpu_card_number 
        --initial initial_training(1)_or_subsequent_training(0)
        --portion active_learning_portion_out_of_total_acquisition
        --epochs epochs
        --es validation_save(1)_or_no_validation_save(0)

# Detail Explanation for arguments
--card      = Do Nvidia-smi and see which GPU to run the code on 
--initial   = (1) if the network is trained before active learning for initialization or (0) if network is trained after each active learning round
--portion   = active_learning_portion_out_of_total_acquisition e.g. 1 to 16 out of 16 rounds
--epochs    = Number of epochs to run per acquisition rounds
--es        = (1) if validation is done with early stop to save the model or (0) if the model is saved each epoch regardless of validation


# E.g. 
python train_net.py 
        --card 0 
        --initial 1
        --portion 1
        --epochs 100
        --es 1

Above code runs train_net.py on GPU:0 for initialization before active learning for 100 epochs with early stop and validation based saving

!!!!! IMPORTANT NOTE !!!!!
For Initial run before active learning please set portion as 1

The reason for portion to start with 1 is as follows:


for portion in range(1, total_number_of_acquisitions):
    if portion == 1:
        do train_net.py (initial = 1, portion = portion)
    else:
        do train_net.py (initial = 0, portion = portion)
    do active.py (func = random or tod, portion = portion)



****** FOR active.py ******

# TO RUN
python active.py 
        --card gpu_card_number 
        --portion active_learning_portion_out_of_total_acquisition
        --func random/tod

# Detail Explanation for arguments
--card      = Do Nvidia-smi and see which GPU to run the code on 
--portion   = active_learning_portion_out_of_total_acquisition e.g. 1 to 16 out of 16 rounds
--func      = Acquisition function to be either random or tod


# E.g. 
python train_net.py 
        --card 0 
        --portion 1
        --func tod

Above code runs active.py on GPU:0 for first acquisition round with TOD acquisition function
