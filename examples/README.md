# ROSE Examples

The ROSE example applications included here depend on additional python modules
to function properly.  You can install those as follows:

`pip install numpy scikit-learn`

After that step, use `run_me.py` for the individual examples to execute them

  - `active_learn/`: several basic active learning applications
  - `reinforcement_learn/`: application which uses ROSE for reinforcement learning
  - `uq_active_learn/`: active learning application which uses uncertainty quanitification
  - `use_cases/`: a collection of various use cases expressed in ROSE (to be extended)
