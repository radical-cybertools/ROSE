## What is ROSE? üåπ

The RADICAL Optimal & Smart-Surrogate Explorer (ROSE) toolkit is a framework designed to support the concurrent and adaptive execution of simulation, surrogate training, and selection tasks on High-Performance Computing (HPC) resources. ROSE is a Python package that provides tools for developing active learning methods for scientific applications. It enables users to define simulation and surrogate training tasks and automatically manage their execution on HPC resources.

ROSE also includes tools to facilitate the selection of the most effective surrogate model for a given simulation based on performance metrics.

ROSE leverages [**RADICAL-Cybertools**](https://radical-cybertools.github.io), a set of middleware building blocks that simplify the development of sophisticated scientific workflows on HPC resources.


## Why ROSE? üöÄüöÄüöÄ
ROSE allows you to enable, scale, and accelerate your active learning workflows across thousands of CPU cores and GPUs effectively and efficiently with just a few lines of code.
ROSE is built on the [**RADICAL-Pilot**](https://github.com/radical-cybertools/radical.pilot) runtime system, a powerful execution engine that enables the distributed execution of millions of scientific tasks and applications such as executables, funtions and containers effortlessly.
